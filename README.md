Welcome to The MarketPlace
==========================

* The MarketPlace is an application that my colleagues (Collins Sirmah + Queeneth Odimegwu) and I  proposed for a business competition at Claflin University.

* Claflin University's Inaugural Entrepreneurship Competition held on February 10 was a part of the University’s third annual Business Week, themed “The Next Generation of Global Leaders.”

This web application is still under construction!

P.S. The website was bootstrapped using the "BeachStrap" template from Wrap BootStrap. This template was purchased.
